### What we are solving?

* Lack of awareness of various social campaigns run by NGOs.

* Many ongoing campaigns, but no common place to see them all.

* NGOs to focus on campaign and its publicity at the same time.

### How it works?

* NGOs are provided with an admin console to manage their campaigns. 

* They manage campaigns details on the console and publish them live.

* It gets instantly available to all We Care users on the website and the application.

### Future Plans

* Dividing Campaigns based on type

* Searching for Campaigns

* Reminders for Campaigns

* Attracting more NGOs

* iOS Mobile App
